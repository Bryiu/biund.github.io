This project was a little bit easier than standard CSS

I definitely need to work on media queries and cleaner code in this project

Overall, for the second website that i had built i am ok with it. 
    Obviously in an ocean of knowlege that i am learning it becomes more and more difficult to see the shore
    However spending one week learning a new skill while doing homework it's not bad.

I really think however what i am submitting for homework isnt neccesarily what i learned. 
    If i can improve the connect between brain and fingers on things i am more confident with i can do more with a website and add more focus on weak points.
    I can understand and read certain parts of code, but in typing its not all there. with repitition i think i will get there. 
    Also I am more confident with my ability to research different ideas that i would have in building a website and applying it to a project.

The more websites that i make the more i really, really want to play around with concepts that i havent learned in class (yet, yet maybe).
I would like to definitely work more with animations and the interaction of the mouse in a website. 
Indian Motorcycles played around with CAD in a website a little and so did BMW?.. anyways.
