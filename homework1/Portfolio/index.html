    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p id="words"><img id="me" alt="Picture of me" src="./assets/images/me.jpg" height="150px" width="150px">
      I've been in manufacturing for the past 8 years and looking for a change. As a second year employee in the
      Engineering group I enjoy the problem solving and diversity in challenges. At times I have the opportunity to be
      creative with the use of Solidworks. <br><br>
      What has drawn me to programming is.. well I enjoy it. It's like making CAD from front to back and much like my
      current role I am hindered by my ability. <br><br>
      I would like to see how my skills progress in this field. I cannot know it all, nor remember everything that I
      have learned, but the best part is what comes after.
